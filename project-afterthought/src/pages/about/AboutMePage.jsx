            <p>Hi there! My name is <b>Aaron Gee</b>!
            I am a Computer Science & Engineering graduate from University of California, Irvine.
            I enjoy learning, practicing, and teaching others the wonders of computers, from coding 
            to building them. I hope to use the skills God has given me to glorify His name and improve 
            the lives of others around me!</p>
